    <h1>Assignment 2: Testing your Understanding</h1>
    <p>It's really scary just how low quality locks the company <strong>Masterlock</strong> makes, 
        despite it being such a large company with products commonplace everywhere. 
        I have seen so many videos on just about every single lock they make having 
        unforgivable, easily fixable security flaws in them that it is truly frightening 
        to know that so many people buy their products. Anyone with simple tools and basic 
        knowledge of locks can open nearly any <strong>Masterlock</strong> product without a key. 
        That being said, though, <strong>Masterlock</strong> can make durable locks like any other 
        company, so the fact that forceful entry methods to bypass locks are much more common probably 
        tilts things in their favor. If you want to see a few examples of what I am talking about, you 
        can watch a video <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5jzHw3lXCQ>here</a> on this topic.
